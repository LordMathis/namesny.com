# Personal Website

This is the source code for my website [namesny.com](https://namesny.com). 

This website is built with React and is open source. It is universally rendered both on server and in browser. The content is served through an API.

## To do

* ~~implement draft support~~
* fix webpack dev server
* add cv/resume section
* support comments
* live reload
* eliminate most hardcoded things (move them to config file)
* remove unnecessary code and overall code cleanup
